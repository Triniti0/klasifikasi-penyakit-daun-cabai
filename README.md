Optimasi MobileNetV2 berbasis Transfer Learning untuk klasifikasi penyakit daun cabai



This is a bachelor project that I developed as a prototype for overcoming the risk of chili harvest depreciation, especially for small farmer. This projects combined the usability of MobileNetV2 as a lightweght model to classified the class categories while maintaining small and quick detection with optimization method such as Transfer Learning and hyperparameter tuning. Both optimization methods applied with metered grid search optimization for small cost computational training.
